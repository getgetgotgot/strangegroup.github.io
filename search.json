    "text": "2.1 Principle 1: Each type of case must have its own tibble. (Draft ver.)\nwhat is principle 1…\n\n2.1.1 Monthly Survey\na. What do monthly survey questionnaires contain?\nThe monthly survey is a compilation of survey questions that were asked across different months. Monthly questionnaire data sets are stored in different CSV files per different month (e.g. SurveyMonthly.2010_04.csv). However, based on our research questions, some of the monthly data sets are irrelevant. We decide to check whether survey questions across different months overlap, if not, we will only take the data sets that are relevant to our research questions into further data tidying process.\nFirst, we imported all the monthly survey data sets into separate data frames:\n\n#creating tibbles for monthly survey per month\n\nmonthly_files &lt;- c(\n  \"InitialSurvey.csv\",\n  \"SurveyMonthly.2010_04.csv\",\n  \"SurveyMonthly.2010_05.csv\",\n  \"SurveyMonthly.2010_07.csv\",\n  \"SurveyMonthly.2010_10.csv\",\n  \"SurveyMonthly.2010_11.csv\",\n  \"SurveyMonthly.2010_12.csv\",\n  \"SurveyMonthly.2011_03.csv\",\n  \"SurveyMonthly.2011_04.csv\"\n)\n\nmonthly_names &lt;- c(\n  \"initial_df\",\n  \"month1004_df\",\n  \"month1005_df\",\n  \"month1007_df\",\n  \"month1010_df\",\n  \"month1011_df\",\n  \"month1012_df\",\n  \"month1103_df\",\n  \"month1104_df\"\n)\nfor(i in 1:length(monthly_files)) {\n  assign(monthly_names[i], read.csv(monthly_files[i]))\n}\n\nBeneath is one example of the code how we check the primary key across all monthly data sets.\n\n#check whether participantID is the primary key\n\nmonth1103_df |&gt; \n  count(participantID) |&gt; \n  filter(n&gt;1)\n\n[1] participantID n            \n&lt;0 rows&gt; (or 0-length row.names)\n\n\nWe used the same code across different monthly data sets and confirmed that participantID is indeed the primary key for all of them. Thus, participantID will be included in all separate tibbles we created to act as the foreign key.\nIn the Friends and Family data compilation, there is a file called SurveyMonthlyQuestionKey.csv, which listed out all the scale names, scale items, and in which monthly survey were they being asked. We manually checked the relevant scales according to the question key file. For example, for the research objectives “friendship network change”, the relevant scale is called “group involvement”, which was measured by several items across different months. For items like “Formal group involvement”, it was only measured once in the initial survey, while for items like “Formal groups participation changed“ and”Formal groups new involvement“, it is more like an update to previous survey responses, thus were measured in both April and May, 2010, as it is listed below.\n\nsurvey_key = read_excel(\"SurveyMonthlyQuestionKey.xlsx\")\ngroup_itemskey = survey_key |&gt; \n  slice(c(168:171, 186:195))\nview(group_itemskey)\n\nAccording to the case we are using, (participant, month), we extract items like “Formal groups participation changed“ and”Formal groups new involvement“ from different monthly survey and store them in different tibbles (e.g. mar_group, apr_group, as mentioned in the following paragraphs).\nb. Creating tibbles for different cases\nExcept for participants’ demographics, the case we select is (participant, months).\nInitial Survey/March, 2010\nFor the case (participant), we create separate tibble for demographics:\n\nmar_demo = initial_df |&gt; select(1:19)\n\ngroup participation\n\nmar_group = initial_df |&gt; select(c(1, 53:76))\n\nCommunication with friends\n\nmar10_commu = initial_df |&gt; select(c(1, 277:280))\n\nMonthly survey April, 2010\nBig 5\n\napr_big5 = month1004_df |&gt; select(c(1, 11:54))\n\ngroup participation\n\napr_group = month1004_df |&gt; select(c(1, 55:114))\nview(apr_group)\n\nMonthly survey May, 2010\ngroup participation\n\nmay_group = month1005_df |&gt;select(c(1, 73:132))\n\nwell-being\n\nmay_well_being = month1005_df |&gt; select(c(1, 32:72))\n\nMonthly survey October, 2010\nsleep actual\n\noct_sleep_act = month1010_df |&gt; select(c(1, 80))\n\nAerobic exercise actual\n\noct_exe_act = month1010_df |&gt; select(c(1, 62))\nview(oct_exe_act)\n\nMonthly survey March, 2011\nCommunication with friends\n\nmar11_commu = month1103_df |&gt; select(c(1, 26:30))\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Location\nLocation every 30 minutes (Location.csv.bz2), with each record including the participant ID associated with the data-collecting mobile phone (participantID), the date-time when the location is recorded (date), the the 68% confidence offset of the estimation from true location(accuracy, in meters), and the estimated location affine-transformed (x, y).\n\n#create a tibble for Location.csv, and have a preview of the data set\n\nlocation_df = read.csv(\"Location.csv\") |&gt; arrange(participantID)\nhead(location_df)\n\n  participantID                date accuracy    x    y\n1    fa10-01-01 2010-09-05 13:21:25       55  256 -858\n2    fa10-01-01 2010-09-05 13:29:56       55  256 -858\n3    fa10-01-01 2010-09-05 15:07:02       60    6   20\n4    fa10-01-01 2010-09-05 15:36:27       60   49   32\n5    fa10-01-01 2010-09-05 16:06:57      919 1578 1513\n6    fa10-01-01 2010-09-05 16:37:01       18 2128 1938\n\n\nWe tried to define the primary key, however, even if we combine all the column names together, the combination itself still cannot identify every single row uniquely, as it is shown in the following code:\n\n#check whether (participantID, date, accuracy, x, y) is the primary key\n\nlocation_df |&gt; \n  count(participantID, date, accuracy, x, y) |&gt; \n  filter(n&gt;1) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n  participantID                date accuracy     x    y n\n1    fa10-01-04 2010-09-29 13:22:53       65 11009 6426 2\n2    fa10-01-04 2010-09-29 13:52:11       13 11223 6036 2\n3    fa10-01-04 2010-09-29 14:03:03        7  6314 5130 2\n4    fa10-01-04 2010-09-29 14:12:59      871   670  987 2\n5    fa10-01-04 2010-09-29 14:22:59       60   -12  -35 2\n6    fa10-01-07 2010-12-07 15:13:12        9  4563 4925 2\n\n\nWe deemed that the duplicates were produced due to faulty data collection methods after reviewing the data description. Thus, we decided to remove duplicated data that has the exact value under every variable:\n\nlocation_df = location_df |&gt; distinct()\n\nIn the new data frame, we found that (participantID, date) is the primary key, as it is shown in the following code:\n\n#check whether (participantID, date) is the primary key\n\nlocation_df |&gt; \n  count(participantID, date) |&gt; \n  filter(n&gt;1)\n\n[1] participantID date          n            \n&lt;0 rows&gt; (or 0-length row.names)\n\n\nIn the final data frame, for the case participant ID, no characteristic was involved. For the case (participantID, date), we created a separate tibble according to principle 1:\n\ndate_coordinates = location_df |&gt; \n  select(participantID, date, x, y) |&gt; \n  distinct()"

We use the pivot_longerfunction to transition from the wide format to a longer one, with new column headers Formal_Or_Informal and Group_Number storing the names either preceding or appended to the Group_Belongingvariable. The problem lays with the fact that the variable Group_Number does not store the value of the ith group for each of the n participants, but the value of the ith formal or ith informal group. This is lacking in clarity. We thus simply count the rows which share the same participantID.\n\nmar_group_belonging &lt;- mar_group |&gt;\n  select(participantID, contains(\"belong.to\"))|&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = 'Formal.groups.belong.to..Group.1.': 'Informal.groups.belong.to..Group.6.',\n    names_to = c(\"Formal_or_Informal\", \"Group_Number\"),\n    names_pattern = \"(Formal|Informal)\\\\.groups\\\\.belong\\\\.to\\\\.\\\\.Group\\\\.(\\\\d+)\\\\.\",\n    values_to = \"Group_Belonging\",\n    values_drop_na = TRUE) |&gt;\n  group_by(participantID) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Group_Number = row_number()\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup() \n\nSecond, the same procedure is applied to the involvement columns.\n\nmar_group_involvement &lt;- mar_group |&gt;\n  select(participantID, contains(\".involvement\"))|&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = 'Formal.group.involvement..Group.1.': 'Informal.group.involvement..Group.6.',\n    names_to = c(\"Formal_or_Informal\", \"Group_Number\"),\n    names_pattern = \"(Formal|Informal)\\\\.group\\\\.involvement\\\\.\\\\.Group\\\\.(\\\\d+)\\\\.\",\n    values_to = \"Group_Involvement\",\n    values_drop_na = TRUE) |&gt;\n    group_by(participantID) |&gt;\n    mutate(\n      Group_Number = row_number()\n    ) |&gt;\n    ungroup() \n\nLast, we left join the two artificially split tibbles to recreate the full one. mar_group_involvement features {r}nrow(mar_group_belonging) observations, and `{r}nrow(mar_group_involvement)``, meaning that certain belonged-to groups have missing values for involvement.
